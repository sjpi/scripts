# Entropy Analysis

This script, `entropy_v1.sh`, analyzes the entropy (randomness) of `.php` files within a specified dir and outputs a list of files (sorted) based on their entropy values. Used for malware on wordpress but general ideas of use:

- Detecting obfuscated or encoded `.php` files (e.g., malware or compromised scripts).
- Investigating randomness or correlation in `.php` file content.

## Features
- Scans all `.php` files within the `./backup-3-22-24/` directory. - Directory will need set.
- Calculates entropy using the `ent` command.
- Extracts and sorts files based on their **Serial Correlation Coefficient**.
- Outputs results to `entropy.txt` in ascending order of entropy values.

## Prerequisites
- **`ent` Command**: Ensure the `ent` tool for entropy calculation is installed.
  - Install on Debian/Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ent
    ```
  - Install on macOS using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install ent
    ```

## Usage
1. Clone or download the script to your desired location.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x entropy_v1.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./entropy_v1.sh
   ```
4. The results will be saved in `entropy.txt`.

## Output
- **`entropy.txt`**: A sorted list of `.php` files with their corresponding entropy values.
- **Format:**
  ```
  <file_path> <entropy_value>
  ```

## Cleanup
The script automatically removes temporary files (`entropy.tmp.txt`) after execution.

## Notes
- The directory scanned is hardcoded as `./backup-3-22-24/`. Update the script to modify this path if needed.
- High entropy values in `.php` files may indicate obfuscation or encoding.

## Example Output
```
./backup-3-22-24/file1.php 0.4567
./backup-3-22-24/file2.php 0.7894
./backup-3-22-24/file3.php 0.8921
```

## Troubleshooting
- **`ent: command not found`**: Ensure the `ent` tool is installed and available in your PATH.
- Ensure the directory `./backup-3-22-24/` exists and contains `.php` files.

Created for analyzing entropy and detecting anomalies in `.php` files.
Good Luck!
